# Virtual-Reality Project 2

# Educating Traffic rules & signs in VR

## Abstract

This project educates a person about the traffic rules and signs (TRS) for driving in VR. As it helps in understanding the traffic rules and signs for driving in the USA which will ultimately result in reducing the number of collisions. This project consists of two modules. Module 1 focuses on traffic signs and Module 2 focuses on traffic signals. This can be further deployed in the driver's license course for evaluating driverâ€™s knowledge about Traffic rules and signs before a person actually begins practicing driving in the real world.


## Statistics:

### Collisions caused by disobeying traffic signals and sign

* According to the Federal Highway Administration(FHA), every year, approximately 2.5 million intersection collisions are caused by disobeying traffic signals and signs. It is also the second-largest category of accidents, lead by only rear-end collisions.

* National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there were on average 1,578 fatalities each year resulting from two-vehicle traffic crashes at intersections controlled by traffic signals and signs. Approximately 29% were caused by drivers who failed to yield the right-of-way at traffic signals.

* Of the two-car accidents at intersections controlled by traffic signals, 43% were Straight Crossing Path (SCP) crashes and 31% were Left Turn Across Path/Opposite Direction (LTAP/OD) crashes.
